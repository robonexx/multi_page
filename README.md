# React router multi-page

Udemy course by Shaun Pelling - Bulding web apps with react & firebase 
https://www.udemy.com/course/build-web-apps-with-react-firebase/

Some minor changes due to react router being updated to version 6, and the course is using an older version

Learned new while doing this part due this update.
So learned to use the element when directing to the page components instead of "component" also tried out the useNavigate instead of useHistory ive use useHistory before but never used useNavigate so it was nice to try out the new in react-router-dom v6 

Re used the fetch hook that was created in an earlier part of this course

Also this part is using the json db server
